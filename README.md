# Global-Mental-Health-Trends
# Brief Description
Currently enrolled in the Cisco Data Analytics Course in order to develop my analytical skills and build my portfolio. This is the (Silver-ranked) dataset I have downloaded from Kaggle based on a topic I am passionate about--Mental Health. i am particularly interested in mental health and issues of neurodivergence in an African setting where until only recently, the topic was taboo. we are on the path to recognising that it is a serious issue but what of the analysis behind it, what characteristics does the data reveal?
